# EDUCATION
**Ph.D.**, Economics, University of Oregon, OR, USA \hfill _2021 (expected)_

- Dissertation: Essays On High Frequency Macroeconomic Monitoring
- Committee: Jeremy Piger (Chair), George Evans, David Evans, Thien H. Nguyen (Computer Science)
- Fields of Expertise: applied macroeconomics, time-series econometrics, forecasting, textual analysis

**M.S.**, Policy Economics, University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign, IL, USA \hfill _2015_

**B.S.**, Economics, University of International Business and Economics, Beijing, China  \hfill _2013_

  - Economics Honors Program (Minor in Japanese)

# RESEARCH
**Nowcasting Business Phases with High and Mixed Frequency Data** (Work in progress)

- Developed a novel real-time dataset of macroeconomic variables at quarterly, monthly, weekly and daily frequencies.
- Measured the economic activity at daily intervals using dynamic factor models, and measured the probability of expansions and recessions in real time. 
- This work elucidated that the use of higher frequency data significantly improves the speed at which expansions and recessions can be identified in U.S. since 1980.

<!--- I take a three-step approach. First, I use the mixed frequency dynamic factor model to extract a coincident index of real economic activity using daily, weekly, monthly and quarterly data. Second, I train a variety of supervised machine learning classification techniques to classify the coincident index into recession and expansion regimes. Finally, I use these trained classifiers to evaluate the evidence for new business cycle turning points in end-of-sample data that has not yet been classified by the NBER. --->

**A New High Frequency, News Based, Indicator of Macroeconomic Activity** (Work in progress)

- Developed a weekly News-Based Sentiment Index (NBSI) regarding economic conditions based on articles sourced from The Wall Street Journal using dictionary methods.
- Assessed the validity of this developed NBSI by tracking a wide range of monthly macroeconomic activity measures. 
- Estimated the usefulness of NBSI in identifying U.S. expansions and recessions in real time. 

**Is the Response of Economic Output to Monetary Policy Asymmetric in China?** (Working paper)

- Estimated monetary policy shocks in China, using a combination of dynamic factors models and factor-augmented vector autoregression.
- Applying local projection methods, I determined that the monetary policy shock has larger impacts on output growth during low-growth states and that monetary policy shock has larger impacts on aggregate price during high-growth states.

<!--- I take a four-step approach. First, Chinese economic activity and aggregate price level are measured using dynamic factors models. Second, monetary policy shocks are identified with Choleski residuals from a factor-augmented vector autoregression. Third, high-growth vs. low-growth phases are measured using a smooth transition logistic function. Lastly, the response of economic activity and price to monetary policy shocks in high-growth periods vs. low-growth periods are estimated via the local projection method--->


<!---
- This paper is the first to study asymmetry in the response of monetary policy on the Chinese economy over the business cycle. Asymmetry is defined in terms of the effects of monetary policy in high-growth periods vs. low-growth periods. High-growth and low-growth phases are measured using a smooth transition logistic function. Using local projection method, I find evidence that monetary policy shocks have larger impacts on output growth during low-growth states; during high-growth states, monetary policy shocks have larger impacts on inflation. This evidence is consistent with a convex aggregate supply curve

**Forecasting Using Bayesian VAR** 
- This paper uses a quarterly US data set on inflation rate, unemployment rate, and interest rate from 1948Q1 to 2018Q1, and then performs an (pseudo) out-of-sample 1-period and 4-period forecast
- This paper uses Bayesian method to estimate a VAR(2) model, based on 2 analytical priors (Minnesota prior and Natural Conjugate prior), and 2 non-analytical priors (Independent Normal - Wishart prior and Stochastic Search Variable Selection prior)
- This paper shows that SSVC prior performs a better 1-period forecast, and independent Normal-Wishart prior performs a better 4-period forecast, in terms of minimal mean squared forecast error
- As forecast horizon gets longer, Minnesota prior generates a large forecast error. Non-analytical prior performs better than analytical priors in terms of forecast ability, especially when forecast horizon gets longer
--->

<!---
**Detecting the Potential Conspirators** (Working paper, with Yizhi Chen and Dong Wang, Awarded Meritorious Winner of 2012 Mathematical Contest in Modeling by the Consortium for Mathematics & Applications) 

- Analyzing data on confirmed criminals, this project applies degree, betweenness and connection in social network analysis to measure crime probabilities of suspects in the network.
- I explored analytic hierarchy process and pointwise mutual information methods to quantify semantic orientation of messages conveyed in a crime network.

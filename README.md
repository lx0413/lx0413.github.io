This is the repo that creates and hosts my personal website, https://lx0413.github.io/

I followed the tutorials written by Emily C. Zabor to set up this website, https://www.emilyzabor.com/tutorials/rmarkdown_websites_tutorial.html

Ed Rubin's personal website has also been very helpful, https://edrub.in/index.html

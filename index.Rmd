Welcome! I am an assistant professor of economics at Butler University, Indianapolis, Indiana. I received a Ph.D. in Economics at the University of Oregon in 2021, and an M.S. in Policy Economics at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign in 2014. 

<!-- fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://economics.uoregon.edu/) at the [University of Oregon](https://www.uoregon.edu/).  -->

[Nowcasting](https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/policy/nowcast) is the prediction of the present state of the economy with real-time data. My [current research](https://lx0413.github.io/research.html) focuses on nowcasting U.S. recessions using a novel high-frequency news-based sentiment index and real-time macroeconomic data at mixed frequencies. I also study the asymmetrical effects of monetary policy. Outside of economics, I enjoy swimming and weight training.

Welcome! I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the University of Oregon. I received a M.S. at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign in 2014. My current research focuses on nowcasting U.S. recessions using mixed-frequency macroeconomic data  and a novel high-frequency news-based sentiment index. I also study the asymmetry effects of monetary policy. Outside of economics, I enjoy swimming and weight training. I am available on the job market in the 2020-2021 academic year.

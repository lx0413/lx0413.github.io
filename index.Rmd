Welcome! I am a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in the [Department of Economics](https://economics.uoregon.edu/) at the [University of Oregon](https://www.uoregon.edu/). I received a M.S. at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign in 2014. My [current research](https://lx0413.github.io/research.html) focuses on nowcasting U.S. recessions using mixed-frequency macroeconomic data and a novel high-frequency news-based sentiment index. I also study the asymmetry effects of monetary policy. Outside of economics, I enjoy swimming and weight training. 

I am available on the job market in the 2020-2021 academic year. In addition to academic jobs, I also seek an economist, data scientist or quantitative analyst job in the industry.

## Teaching Philosophy

As an Instructor of Record at the University of Oregon, I work closely with students to help them achieve personal academic goals and organize graduate employee grading. Entering Fall 2020, I have taught solely and assisted in teaching 4 undergraduate classes a total of 8 times, in person and online. Enrollment ranges from small groups of 16 students to large classes of 85 students. 

As an educator in economics, I aim to create an inclusive environment where students are able to apply quantitative & graphical skills, economic intuition, and economic theory to understand the evolving real-world issues, news, and events. I pride myself in helping students with developing economic tools to problem solve and being available to assist students outside of class whenever the need arises.
